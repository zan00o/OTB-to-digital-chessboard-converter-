"""
warp.py
Functions for ordering corners and warping a chessboard image to a top-down view.
Used in annotate_corners.py, infer_image.py, and build_dataset.py.
Using the points from the corner annotation step, we compute a homography to warp
the input image to a square top-down view of the chessboard.
